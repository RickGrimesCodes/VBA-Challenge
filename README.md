Hello UNCC Charlotte Data Analyst Bootcamp Gradders! This is my module 2 project!

No code was directly copied, however ussage of Microsoft Co-pilot was used to ask questions about proper syntax, and errors, primarily through Greatest % Increase, Greatest % decrease, and Greatest total Volume.

I ended up saving the wrong thing vba module over my code at one point causing me to have to re-write the part mentioned in line 3, thank god Windows had a restore point, not really important just figured I'd mention it lol.

The code is in VBA-Challenge/Code/SuperDuperStockAnnalyserNewAndImproved.vba

The spreedsheet I used for final testing is in: VBA-Challenge\Test Workbooks\ Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx

The demo of the code is in VBA-Challenge/Demonstration of code. There are two photos, 'Demo2018.PNG' and 'Demo2019.PNG', showing the final results of the code running; finally there is a quick video demonstrating the code in action, titled CodeDemonstration.MKV

I hope everything works as intended, and this README is good, haven't learned what all I can do with this yet. Have a great day!
